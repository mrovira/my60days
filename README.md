# MVTEC - Creative module project

This project is part of the creative subject in the MTVEC. 

We were asked to track something in our lives during 60 days.
Mine was focused on my reading habits.

## Comments

I have used layer-cake for all the visualizations, github, svelte and vercel to deploy the project.

# Lessons learned
- How to use layer cake
- I have to increase the reading progress to achieve my personal goal for 2023
- How to use Figma

# Pending things
- Improve the picture section as right now is a table. I would like it to have zoom applied to check better the progress every day
- Have the 2 radial charts in the same chart. As they were done with layer-cake, I couldn't adapt two in one.
- One chart with the time spent reading every day.


Special thanks to Xaqu√≠n G.V. for his patience in me delivering the project.
